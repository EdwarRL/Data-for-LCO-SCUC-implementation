# IEEE-Data-for-LCO-SCUC
### The excel files containt the data of IEEE 30-bus and 118-bus systems modified to obtain the Lossy Co-optimized Security Constrained Unit Commitment (LCO-SCUC) results. The network data of branches, nodes and sensitivity factors are shown for one period. The data of unit generators and load for 24 period was generate to performance the simulations.
