<p align="justify">
In the Excel files, the data of IEEE 30-bus and 118-bus systems have been modified to obtain the results of Lossy Co-optimized Security Constrained Unit Commitment (LCO-SCUC) . The network data, including branches, nodes and sensitivity factors are displayed for single period. Additionally, the data for generator units and loads for 24 periods has been generated to perform the simulations.
