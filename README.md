<p align="justify">
In the excel files are the data of IEEE 30-bus and 118-bus systems modified to obtain the Lossy Co-optimized Security Constrained Unit Commitment (LCO-SCUC) results. The network data of branches, nodes and sensitivity factors are shown for one period. The data of unit generators and loads for 24 periods was generated to perform the simulations.
